## Flowgorithm Programming Structures

### Sequence (Linear Execution)

A **sequence** structure executes instructions in order, one after another. 

- Use **Input** to get values.
- Use **Process** for calculations or variable assignments.
- Use **Output** to display the result.
  
**Example:**  
1. `Input Name`  
2. `Display "Hello, " + Name`  

### Selection (Decision-Making)

A **selection** structure is used for conditional branching in Flowgorithm (making decisions using IF/ELSE). It uses a **Decision (Diamond)** symbol in the flowchart to branch into different paths based on a condition.

#### Simple IF-ELSE

- In a simple selection, the flowchart splits into two paths (true/false) based on one condition.  
**Example:**  
1. `Input Number`  
2. `IF Number MOD 2 == 0 THEN`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Output "Even"`  
3. `ELSE`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `Output "Odd"`  

#### Nested IF-ELSE

- Nested selection structures are used when multiple conditions need to be checked in sequence.  
**Example:**
```
1. Input Score  
    IF Score >= 90 THEN  
        Output "Grade A"  
    ELSE IF Score >= 80 THEN  
        Output "Grade B"  
    ELSE IF Score >= 70 THEN  
        Output "Grade C"  
    ELSE  
        Output "Fail"
```  

### Loop (Iteration)

A **loop** structure allows repeating a set of instructions multiple times. Always ensure there is an exit condition to prevent infinite loops.

#### WHILE Loop

- A **WHILE** loop executes *as long as* a specified condition remains true.  
**Example (print numbers 1 to 5):**  
```
Set Counter = 1
WHILE Counter <= 5  
    Output Counter`  
    Counter = Counter + 1
```  

#### FOR Loop

- A **FOR** loop executes a *fixed number of times*.  
**Example (print numbers 1 to 5):**  
```
FOR i FROM 1 TO 5  
    Output i
``` 

#### DO-WHILE Loop (Post-Test Loop)

- A **DO-WHILE** loop executes the loop body **at least once**, then continues *while* a condition remains true (check at the end).  
**Example (ask for input until the user enters a positive number):**  
```
DO  
    Input Number  
WHILE Number <= 0
```  

### Nested Loops (Loop Inside a Loop)

A **nested loop** is a loop inside another loop, used for grid-like repetition or when one loop controls repetition of another.  
**Example (Multiplication Table with nested FOR loops):**  
```
FOR i FROM 1 TO 5
    FOR j FROM 1 to 5
        Output i * j  
```

## Common Flowgorithm Functions

| **Function** | **Usage Example**                                       |
|-------------:|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `Input`      | `Input Name`                                            |
| `Output`     | `Output "Hello, " + Name`                               |
| `If-Else`    | `IF Age >= 18 THEN Output "Adult" ELSE Output "Minor"`   |
| `While`      | `WHILE i <= 5 DO Output i` <br>*(with loop body `i = i + 1`)* |
| `For`        | `FOR i FROM 1 TO 5 DO Output i`                          |
| `Do-While`   | `DO Input Number WHILE Number <= 0`                     |

## Tasks

### Task 1: Sequence Structure (Linear Execution)  

- **Problem Statement:** Create a flowchart that asks the user for their name, age, and favorite color. Then, display a greeting message including their details.

- **Flowchart Components:**  
  - Input: Ask for name, age, and color  
  - Process: Concatenate the response into a message  
  - Output: Display the message  

- **Expected Output Example:**  
    ```
    Enter your name: Alice  
    Enter your age: 20  
    Enter your favorite color: Blue  
    Output: Hello Alice! You are 20 years old and your favorite color is Blue.
    ```

### Task 2: Selection Structure (Decision-Making using IF/ELSE)  

- **Problem Statement:** Create a flowchart that asks the user for a number. If the number is **even**, display "The number is even"; otherwise, display "The number is odd."

- **Flowchart Components:**  
  - Input: Ask the user for a number  
  - Process: Use an **if-else** condition to check if the number is even (i.e., number mod 2 = 0)  
  - Output: Display "Even" or "Odd"  

- **Expected Output Example:**  
    ```
    Enter a number: 7  
    Output: The number is odd.  

    Enter a number: 8  
    Output: The number is even.
    ```

### Task 3: Loop Structure (Using a WHILE Loop or FOR Loop)  

- **Problem Statement:** Create a flowchart that prints numbers from 1 to 5 using a loop.

- **Flowchart Components:**  
  - Process: Initialize a counter variable to 1  
  - Loop: Use a **while** loop or **for** loop to repeat the process until the counter reaches 5  
  - Output: Print numbers from 1 to 5  

- **Expected Output Example:**  
    ```
    Output: 1  
    Output: 2  
    Output: 3  
    Output: 4  
    Output: 5  
    ```

### Task 4: Loop Structure (User-Defined Range)  

- Modify **Task 3** to allow the user to input a number **N**, then print numbers from **1 to N** using a loop.
